Link to Mustafa Ramadan's Personal Website: https://sheltered-taiga-18436.herokuapp.com/index.html

In my personal website, the theme of the website acts as a personal site that represents who I am via, resume, relvant projects completed, social media links and photos.  I have 3 HTML links connected to this assignment.
- index.html 
  - This acts as a landing page that includes the navigation bar, internal links to other pages, and external links. In addition, I've created an interactive image grid that represents a duplicated photo of myself.

- resume.html
  - This acts as a page that includes a div of interests and a div on skills. Within each we have an unordered list of lists. Also, at the top of the page, aside from the navigation bar, you'll find photos that are aligned in consecutive order across the width of the page.

- previouswork.html
  - This acts as a page that includes all of my previous CS projects that have been completed throughout my Masters at NEU. This was organized via the construction of an HTML table.

In order to address the completion of each of the requirements to this assignment, I will address how they've been taken care of one at a time.

1) The landing page i.e. the index.html is the page that loads up from my heroku deployed page. You will find a navigation bar that links to the other pages of the website directory. A darker blue color will appear over the corresponding page on the navigation bar implying that is the page you are currently vieweing.  You will also find an interactive image grid on the button of the page.

2) The navigation bar can be found on each of the 3 internal pages described above. They are also fixed, thus, when you scroll, they will follow the top of the page and wont be lost from sight. There are no deadends as each page can link to any other corresponsing page that is clicked on. When resizal occurs, the navigation bar remains. Also with the navigation bar, you will find that when you hover over each unique element, they will highlight.

3) On the landing page (index.html), you will find two internal links. One that goes to the resume page (resume.html), and one that goes to the previous work page (previouswork.html). These links can be found on the body of the index.html page, or on the navigation bar. Once connected to either the resume or the previous work page, the navigation bar will also be found on those pages which can link you to either the landing page (index.html) or any of the resume or previous work pages.

4) On the landing page (index.html), you will find two separate links to my social medias. One that connects to my instagram page, and one that connects my facebook page. You can only access these external links on the landing page (index.html).

5) On the previous work page (previouswork.html), you will find an html table that has been styled according to the theme of the website. Each row contains a unique set of date/project/skills per unique experience. The spacing of the table has been set to provide for room between each element. Also every other row switches between light and dark to make the table easiluy readable. Finally, you will find that when you hover over each unique element, they will highlight.

6) Interactivity of the website occurs 3 unique times throughout the website. The first is the navigation bar which can be found on every page. When you hover over each unique element, they will highlight. The second interactive element is the previous work table that also provide hover interactivity over each unique element as that element will be highlighted. Finally, and most complex, on the landing page (index.html), you will find on the bottom of the page an interactive image grid that has 3 unique buttons the user can click on. By utilizing javascript, when the user clicks on one of the three buttons labeled "1 per row", "2 per row", "4 per row", the image grid will display images according to the button clicked in a grid like manner. There are a total of 8 images (all of them are the same image), but the way the images are displayed is how I wanted the image grid to be displayed and function.

7) By checking my developer tools, and assessing how my site displays on all sorts of displays (mobile or webpage) on all unique different sizes, the website displays perfectly normal on ALL displays. :)
